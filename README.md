## üöÄ Project Overview

**GlowGrid Gauntlet** is a modern take on a classic game. It‚Äôs a single-page React application designed with a jaw-dropping, retro-futuristic neon aesthetic. The goal was to create something not just functional, but visually beautiful and engaging, focusing on smooth animations and a responsive, dark-first user interface.

### The "Vibe Coding" Philosophy in Action

-   **Styling & Animation:** Provided suggestions for Tailwind CSS classes to achieve the neon glow effect and helped structure the animation logic with Framer Motion for seamless screen transitions.
-   **Debugging:** Acted as a rubber duck, helping to quickly identify and resolve errors, like misplaced imports or logical flaws in the game state.
